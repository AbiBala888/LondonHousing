1.1 Background

London is one of the biggest cities in the world with such a diverse set of boroughs, 32 in total. 
The size of London means that it is very difficult for people to be able to discover all of these areas in detail. 
Houses in certain areas of London have become mostly unaffordable to new buyers 
and it is hard to find good alternatives to these areas.
They may have seen a specific area that they like but it could be out of their price range, 
therefore they may want to find another London borough which is similar to that borough but with lower house prices.

This report aims to compare house prices in different London boroughs while grouping neighbourhoods
so that house buyers can find similar areas to ones they liked but with cheaper house prices.
This report will look at amenities in each borough, 
the types that mostly occur and the frequency so that similar boroughs can be found.

1.2 Data

This report uses the co-ordinates for each London borough in order to locate them [1]. 

The Foursquare API is then used to bring back the variety of venues in each borough and the frequency of them.

A London government website provided the average house prices per borough which have been utilised for this project [2].
